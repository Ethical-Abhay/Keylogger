# Keylogger
🛡️ Custom Key Input Logger for Educational Cybersecurity Projects
🚀 Built using Python
🔍 Purpose: Understanding Input Monitoring Techniques & Defensive Security

🔧 How it Works:
This tool captures user ke keystrokes in the background using Python libraries (like pynput) to demonstrate how keylogging attacks work — purely for educational and ethical research.

🔐 Why I Built This:
As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I wanted to understand how input capturing works at a programmatic level. This helped me learn:

How keyloggers operate behind the scenes

How to detect and defend against them

How operating systems handle input events

💡 What You’ll Learn:

Basics of key event listening in Python

Logging techniques

Importance of endpoint protection

How antivirus and EDR tools detect such threats

📚 Disclaimer:
This project is strictly for educational purposes and to raise awareness about cyber threats. Unauthorized usage of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Always use such tools in a controlled environment.
